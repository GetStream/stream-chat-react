Most of the application state which is the main driver behind the UI changes of our chat SDK lives within our LLC ([`StreamChat`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js)) - more specifically client and channel instances and is _NOT REACTIVE_ - our React SDK makes these state stores reactive by listening to the same events client does and copies it with the help of `useState` API after it has been changed.

This is how the SDK state pipeline looks like behind the scenes:

```txt
client attaches WS event listeners -> React SDK attaches WS event listeners -> WS event received -> client/channel instance updates its own state -> React SDK pulls the updated state and updates it locally
```

Optimistic updates - if applicable - are handled by the React SDK.

## Active Channel & Channel State

Before you can access the _reactive_ channel state you'll need to make one of the available channels active either through the use of the [`ChannelList`](../components/core-components/channel-list.mdx) component which handles this for you ([default setup](../basics/getting-started.mdx#your-first-app-with-stream-chat-react)) or by passing the `channel` instance to a [`Channel`](../components/core-components/channel.mdx) component as a prop or lastly, by calling `setActiveChannel`.

The SDK comes with [`ChatContext`](../components/contexts/chat-context.mdx) which holds (among other things) currently active channel and forwards LLC instance passed to the [`Chat`](../components/core-components/chat.mdx) component.

:::note
You can use either `channel` prop on the [`Channel`](../components/core-components/channel.mdx) component or [`setActiveChannel`](../components/contexts/chat-context.mdx#setactivechannel) function. You cannot use both at the same time.
:::

Channel as a prop example:

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Channel, useChatContext } from 'stream-chat-react';

export const ChannelWrapper = ({ channelId, channelType = 'messaging', children }) => {
  const [activeChannel, setActiveChannel] = useState(undefined);
  const { client } = useChatContext();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!channelId) return;

    const channel = client.channel(channelId, channelType);

    setActiveChannel(channel);
  }, [channelId, channelType]);

  return <Channel channel={activeChannel}>{children}</Channel>;
};
```

Example with `setActiveChannel` function:

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useCreateChatClient, useChatContext, Chat, Channel } from 'stream-chat-react';

const ActiveChannelSetter = ({ channelId, channelType }) => {
  const { client, setActiveChannel } = useChatContext();

  useEffect(() => {
    const channel = client.channel(channelId, channelType);
    setActiveChannel(channel);
  }, [channelType, channelId]);

  return null;
};

const App = () => {
  const client = useCreateChatClient(userData);

  if (!client) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <Chat client={client}>
      <ActiveChannelSetter channelId='random' channelType='messaging' />
      <Channel>{/** ...other components... */}</Channel>
    </Chat>
  );
};
```

Afterwards - to access currently active channel you can use `useChatContext` hook as well from any component (or custom hook) which is either direct or indirect child of a Chat component:

```tsx
import { useChatContext } from 'stream-chat-react';

export const useActiveChannel = () => {
  const { channel } = useChatContext();

  return channel;
};
```

Currently active [channel state](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react/blob/master/src/context/ChannelStateContext.tsx#L36-L56) can be accessed through the [`ChannelStateContext`](../components/contexts/channel-state-context.mdx) with the help of the `useChannelStateContext` hook - meaning any component which is either direct or indirect child of the `Channel` component can access such state.

The example bellow shows how to reach `members` property coming from the channel state:

```tsx
import { Channel, useChannelStateContext } from 'stream-chat-react';

const MembersCount = () => {
  const { members } = useChannelStateContext();

  return <div>{Object.keys(members).length}</div>;
};

const ChannelWrapper = () => (
  <Channel>
    <MembersCount />
  </Channel>
);
```

## Channel List State

[`ChannelList`](../components/core-components/channel-list.mdx) component is a standalone component which (unsurprisingly) holds and manages list of channels. You can access loaded `channels` from [`ChannelListContext`](../components/contexts/channel-list-context.mdx) with the help of `useChannelListContext` hook.

```tsx
import { ChannelList, ChannelPreviewMessenger } from 'stream-chat-react';
import type { ChannelListProps } from 'stream-chat-react';

const CustomPreviewUI = (props) => {
  const { channels } = useChannelListContext();

  return <ChannelPreviewMessenger {...props} />;
};

export const CustomChannelList = (props: ChannelListProps) => {
  return <ChannelList Preview={CustomPreviewUI} {...props} />;
};
```
