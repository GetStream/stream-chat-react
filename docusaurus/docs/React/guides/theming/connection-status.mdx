This example will show you how to change the message text in the `ConnectionStatus` component. This status appears when there is a connection issue with the Stream Chat API.

This component is established within the `MessageList` via the `DefaultMessageListNotifications` component in the same file. For a complete override of all of these notifications, see this [detailed example](../adding-notification.mdx), but in this smaller guide
we will replace just the text of one of the components using the Stream [`i18n instance`](./translations.mdx).

## Implementation

The first step is to create an instance of `Streami18n` and pass it into the `Chat` component.

```tsx
const i18nInstance = new Streami18n();

<Chat client={client} i18nInstance={i18nInstance}>
  ...
</Chat>;
```

Next, we can define what text appears during connection issues by overriding the default message via the key value pairing. Check out the full list of [values you can override](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react/blob/master/src/i18n/en.json).

```tsx
const i18nInstance = new Streami18n({
  language: 'en',
  translationsForLanguage: {
    'Connection failure, reconnecting now...': 'Alert, connection issue happening',
  },
});
```

## The Result

<img src={ConnectionStatus} alt='Custom Connection Status Message for Chat' width='700' />
