After initial integration of our SDK, theming is the best option allowing you to alter the appearance and behaviour of our SDK. Through theming you should be able to create a chat experience that is fully on brand for your situation.

In case theming our SDK is not enough, please look into our SDK [customization](../customization/overview.mdx) options instead. Customization allows you the outright replace specific components in our SDK, allowing you to add just the right amount of customization you need.
