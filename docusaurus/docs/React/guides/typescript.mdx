As of version `5.0.0`, `stream-chat-react` has been converted to TypeScript. The `stream-chat` library was converted to TypeScript in version `2.0.0`.
These upgrades not only improve type safety, but also allow user provided typings to be passed to server requests and custom components through
the use of [generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html).

In many cases, TypeScript uses [inference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html) from provided props to establish a component or
value's type. It is therefore important that the proper generics be applied to the `stream-chat` client instance during construction. The
[documentation on `stream-chat` TypeScript](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/docs/typescript.md) has detailed examples of how this can be accomplished.
The Stream Chat client takes a type with seven customizable fields that currently exist in `stream-chat`.

```tsx
const client = new StreamChat<StreamChatGenerics>('YOUR_API_KEY');
```

`StreamChatGenerics` can be defined as a type with the seven generics that correspond to the seven customizable fields as follows:

```tsx
type StreamChatGenerics = {
  attachmentType: LocalAttachmentType;
  channelType: LocalChannelType;
  commandType: LocalCommandType;
  eventType: LocalEventType;
  messageType: LocalMessageType;
  reactionType: LocalReactionType;
  userType: LocalUserType;
};
```

:::note
`LocalAttachmentType`, `LocalChannelType` etc. are type definitions for their respective key as per your application types necessities.

```tsx
type LocalAttachmentType = {
  file_size?: number;
};
type LocalChannelType = Record<string, unknown>;
type LocalCommandType = string;
type LocalEventType = Record<string, unknown>;
type LocalMessageType = Record<string, unknown>;
type LocalReactionType = Record<string, unknown>;
type LocalUserType = {
  image?: string;
};
```

:::

The seven customizable fields these generics extend are provided via `stream-chat`:

1. [`Attachment`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/types.ts)
2. [`ChannelResponse`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/types.ts)
3. [`CommandVariants`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/types.ts)
4. [`Event`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/types.ts)
5. [`MessageBase`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/types.ts)
6. [`Reaction`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/types.ts)
7. [`User`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/types.ts)

All seven generics contain defaults in the component library that can be extended for custom types for Channel, Messages, etc.

```tsx
type DefaultAttachmentType = Record<string, unknown>;
type DefaultChannelType = Record<string, unknown> & {
  image?: string;
};
type DefaultCommandType = string & {};
type DefaultEventType = Record<string, unknown>;
type DefaultMessageType = Record<string, unknown> & {
  isAdminMessage?: boolean;
};
type DefaultReactionType = Record<string, unknown>;
type DefaultUserType = Record<string, unknown> & {
  image?: string;
  nickName?: string;
};
```

Additional fields on the defaults (eg: `file_size`, and `image`) are added by `stream-chat-react` within the SDK. When adding to the subset of generics,
the preceding and interceding generics must also be set in order for the TypeScript compiler to correctly understand intent.

The below example shows how to extend `ChannelType`, `MessageType`, and `UserType` during client instantiation:

```tsx
type StreamChatGenerics = {
  attachmentType: DefaultAttachmentType;
  channelType: DefaultChannelType;
  commandType: DefaultCommandType;
  eventType: DefaultEventType;
  messageType: DefaultMessageType;
  reactionType: DefaultReactionType;
  userType: DefaultUserType;
};
```

```tsx
const client = new StreamChat<StreamChatGenerics>('YOUR_API_KEY');
```

Through this client instantiation, we have added type support for the following values:

- `channel.image`
- `message.isAdminMessage`
- `user.image`
- `user.nickName`

:::note
`DefaultCommandType` extends `string & {}` to maintain intellisense for the included commands. This allows you to extend a string union.
:::

The exported custom context hooks also require generics be applied to correctly type custom returns. For example, the
`useChannelStateContext` hook needs all generics to get a correctly typed return for `channel`.

```tsx
const { channel } = useChannelStateContext<StreamChatGenerics>();
```

:::tip
To see an example of extending the default `Attachment` type, see the [Geolocation Attachment](./theming/actions/geolocation-attachment.mdx#custom-map-attachment)
custom code example.
:::

The current default types can be seen in the [`stream-chat-react` component library](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/types.ts). Any additional custom types
will extend these defaults. Core to understanding this pattern is how generics can be
[applied to JSX elements](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-9.html#generic-type-arguments-in-jsx-elements).
