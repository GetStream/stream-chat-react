The `ChatContext` is exposed by the [`Chat`](../core-components/chat.mdx) component. Since `Chat` wraps the entire chat application, all other components in the library
have access to the values stored in this context. You can access the context values by calling the `useChatContext` custom hook.

## Basic Usage

Pull values from context with our custom hook:

```jsx
const { client, setActiveChannel } = useChatContext();
```

## Values

### client

The `StreamChat` client instance. Any methods from the `stream-chat-js` API interface can be run off this object.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| object |

### channel

The currently active channel, which populates the [`Channel`](../core-components/channel.mdx) component.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| Channel |

### closeMobileNav

The function to close mobile navigation.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

### customClasses

Object containing custom CSS classnames to override the library's default container CSS. See [CSS and Theming](../customization/css-and-theming.mdx)
for implementation assistance.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| object |

### mutes

An array of users that have been muted by the connected user.

| Type   |
| ------ |

### navOpen

When the screen width is at a mobile breakpoint, whether or not the mobile navigation menu is open.

### setActiveChannel

A function to set the currently active channel. This is used in the `ChannelList` component to navigate between channels.
You can override the default behavior by pulling it from context and then utilizing the function.

| Type     |

| function |

### theme

UI theme used for custom styling of components. Default themes are available by channel type and custom themes are supported.

| Type  | Default           |
| ----- | ----------------- |

### useImageFlagEmojisOnWindow

Windows 10 does not support country flag emojis out of the box. It chooses to render these emojis as characters instead.
Stream Chat can override this behavior by loading a custom web font that will render images instead (PNGs or SVGs depending
on the platform). Set this prop to true if you want to use these custom emojis for Windows users.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | false   |
