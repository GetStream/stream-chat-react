The `ChannelStateContext` is a one of the context providers exposed in the [`Channel`](../core-components/channel.mdx) component and is consumable by all of the `Channel` children components.
The context provides all of the state properties and logic for a `channel`, and you can access these by calling the `useChannelStateContext` custom hook.

## Basic Usage

Pull values from context with our custom hook:

```jsx
const { channel, watchers } = useChannelStateContext();
```
