This section provides a high level overview of the library setup, core components, and how they fit together. It's a great
starting point and you can follow along in your code editor. For a complete, step-by-step guide in terms setting up a React
project or instructions on creating specific files, see our [React Chat tutorial](https://getstream.io/chat/react-chat/tutorial/).

## Your First App with Stream Chat React

Before starting, make sure you have installed `stream-chat-react` (and `stream-chat`), as directed in the
[Installation](./installation.mdx) section.

The below example is all the code you need to launch a fully functioning chat experience. The [`Chat`](../components/core-components/chat.mdx)
and [`Channel`](../components/core-components/channel.mdx) components are React context providers that pass a variety of values to their
children, including UI components, stateful data, and action handler functions.

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <Chat client={client}>
    <Channel channel={channel}>
      <Window>
        <ChannelHeader />
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Window>
      <Thread />
    </Channel>
  </Chat>
);
```

## Creating a Chat Client

To communicate with the Stream Chat API, create an instance of Stream Chat client with your API key and pass via props into the `Chat`
component. To generate an API key, you can sign up for a [free 30-day trial](https://getstream.io/chat/trial/) on our website.

Initialize the Stream Chat client:

```jsx
import { StreamChat } from 'stream-chat';

const client = new StreamChat('your_api_key');

<Chat client={client}>{/** children of Chat component*/}</Chat>;
```

## Connecting a User

Tokens are used to authenticate a user. Typically, you send this token from your backend to your front end when a user logs in.
See the [Tokens & Authentication](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/tokens_and_authentication/) documentation to learn more
about creating tokens. For our purposes here, we will assume you have created and retrieved a `userToken`.

To connect a user, call the `connectUser` method on your client instance with the user object and `userToken` provided as arguments.
Connect the user directly after instantiating the client to establish a websocket connection with the Stream Chat API. Once the connection
has been opened, your client instance will begin receiving events from the API.

```jsx
client.connectUser(
  {
    id: 'dave-matthews',
    name: 'Dave Matthews',
  },
  userToken,
);
```

## Creating a Channel

Channels are at the core of Stream Chat. Within a channel you send/receive messages and interact with other users. Once a channel
object has been initialized, the `Channel` component consumes the object and renders your chat app's functionality.

By default, the Stream Chat API provides support for five different [channel types](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/react/channel_features/)
of varying use cases. A channel type is required when creating a channel and dictates the available features and permissions.
The defaults include:

- `messaging`
- `livestream`
- `team`
- `gaming`
- `commerce`

:::note
You can also create [custom channel types](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/react/channel_features/#creating-a-channel-type)
and define your own permission sets.
:::

To create an instance of a channel, call the `channel` method on your client instance. This method takes the following parameters:

- channel type
- channel ID (optional, will be auto-generated by the backend if not supplied)
- channel data

```jsx
const channel = client.channel('messaging', {
  image: 'dave.png',
  name: 'Create a Messaging Channel',
  members: ['dave-matthews', 'trey-anastasio'],
  // option to add custom fields
});
```

## Setting Up the UI Components

Now that we have a client instance, a connected user, and a channel, it's time to look at the core components involved in building
a fully functioning chat application.

### Chat

The [`Chat`](../components/core-components/chat.mdx) component is a React Context provider that wraps the entire Stream Chat application. It provides the [`ChatContext`](../components/contexts/chat-context.mdx)
to its children, which includes the `StreamChat` client instance. All other components within the library must be nested as children
of `Chat` to maintain proper functionality.

The client instance can be accessed with our custom context hook:

```jsx
const { client } = useChatContext();
```

### Channel

The [`Channel`](../components/core-components/channel.mdx) component is a React Context provider that wraps all of the logic, functionality, and UI for an individual chat channel.
It provides five separate contexts to its children:

- [`ChannelStateContext`](../components/contexts/channel-state-context.mdx) - stateful data (ex: `messages` or `members`)
- [`ChannelActionContext`](../components/contexts/channel-action-context.mdx) - action handlers (ex: `sendMessage` or `openThread`)
- [`ComponentContext`](../components/contexts/component-context.mdx) - custom component UI overrides (ex: `Avatar` or `Message`)
- [`EmojiContext`](../components/contexts/emoji-context.mdx) - emoji UI components and data (ex: `EmojiPicker` or `emojiConfig`)
- [`TypingContext`](../components/contexts/typing-context.mdx) - object of currently typing users (i.e., `typing`)

### ChannelList

The [`ChannelList`](../components/core-components/channel-list.mdx) component renders a list of channels and provides a preview for each. Though the `ChannelList` is essential in many chat apps,
it isn't a required piece of the library. If a `ChannelList` component is used, a channel object should not be placed as a prop on the `Channel`
component, as the `ChannelList` handles channel setting internally.

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <Chat client={client}>
    <ChannelList />
    <Channel>
      <Window>
        <ChannelHeader />
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Window>
      <Thread />
    </Channel>
  </Chat>
);
```

### Window

The [`Window`](../components/utility-components/window.mdx) component handles width changes in the main channel to ensure a seamless user experience when opening and closing a `Thread`.

### ChannelHeader

The [`ChannelHeader`](../components/utility-components/channel-header.mdx) displays pertinent information regarding the currently active channel, including image and title.

### MessageList

The [`MessageList`](../components/core-components/message-list.mdx) component renders a list of messages and consumes the various contexts setup from `Channel`. This component accepts a wide variety of optional props for customization needs.

### MessageInput

The [`MessageInput`](../components/message-input-components/message-input.mdx) component is a React Context provider that wraps all of the logic, functionality, and UI for the message input displayed in a channel. It provides the [`MessageInputContext`](../components/contexts/message-input-context.mdx) to its children.

### Thread

The [`Thread`](../components/core-components/thread.mdx) component renders a list of replies tied to a single parent message in a channel's main message list. A `Thread` maintains its own state and renders its own `MessageList` and `MessageInput` components.

## Summary

In addition to the above referenced UI components, client instantiation, and user connection, you need little other code to get a fully functioning chat application up and running. See below for an example of the complete code.

:::note
Remember our [Theming](../guides/theming/overview.mdx) and [Customizing Components](../guides/customization/overview.mdx) sections in our guides. They offer you a lot of flexibility when adopting our SDK.

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { StreamChat } from 'stream-chat';
import {
  Chat,
  Channel,
  ChannelHeader,
  ChannelList,
  MessageList,
  MessageInput,
  Thread,
  Window,
} from 'stream-chat-react';
import '@stream-io/stream-chat-css/dist/css/index.css';

const filters = { type: 'messaging' };
const options = { state: true, presence: true, limit: 10 };
const sort = { last_message_at: -1 };

const App = () => {
const [client, setClient] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
const newClient = new StreamChat('your_api_key');

    const handleConnectionChange = ({ online = false }) => {
      if (!online) return console.log('connection lost');
      setClient(newClient);
    };

    newClient.on('connection.changed', handleConnectionChange);

    newClient.connectUser(
      {
        id: 'dave-matthews',
        name: 'Dave Matthews',
      },
      'your_user_token',
    );

    return () => {
      newClient.off('connection.changed', handleConnectionChange);
      newClient.disconnectUser().then(() => console.log('connection closed'));
    };
}, []);

if (!client) return null;

return (
<Chat client={client}>
<ChannelList filters={filters} sort={sort} options={options} />
<Channel>
<Window>
<ChannelHeader />
<MessageList />
<MessageInput />
</Window>
<Thread />
</Channel>
</Chat>
);
};

export default App;
```

With a basic chat app up and running with our default UI, it's time to take a deep dive into each individual component in the library.
