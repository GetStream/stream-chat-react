## Where to get started

If you are new to our SDK it is best to go through a of our [tutorial](https://getstream.io/chat/react-chat/tutorial/).

After that, our [getting started page](./getting-started.mdx) is a great next step.

:::tip
If you are integrating our SDK, please pay attention to our [Theming](../theming/introduction.mdx) and [Customizing Components](../guides/customization/overview.mdx) sections in our guides. We see that most of our users can get very far by utilizing the flexibility of our SDKs.

## Architecture

A common pattern in the library is the use of context provider hooks. These custom hooks allow for effective value sharing between parent components and their children.
This makes customization straightforward, as you can use our exported hooks in your custom components to receive the exact values needed, while also subscribing to context changes.

The left navigation will guide you to the various documentation sections for information on everything regarding our robust component library. Check out the instructions below for adding the library to your React project.
