Utilizing the Stream Chat API, the Stream Chat React SDK component library includes everything you need to build feature-rich and high functioning chat user experiences right out of the box while also providing many opportunities for customization.
Use cases include team and social messaging, livestream event, livestream gaming, and customer support. The SDK supports rich media messages, reactions, threads, `/` message input commands (for Giphy and more), image uploads, videos, read state, and typing indicators, to name a few.

A common pattern in the library are the context providers hooks (see [Contexts](./contexts/chat_context)) that allows effective value and function sharing between parent components and their children.
This makes customization very straightforward because you can use our exported context providers and hooks in your custom component and receive the exact values needed while also subscribing to context changes.

The left navigation will guide you to the various documentation sections for information on everything regarding our robust SDK. Check out the instructions below for adding the library to your React project.

## Installation

The recommended way to use the Stream Chat SDK is through a package manager. The React SDK is based on top of Stream's [JavaScript Client](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/?language=javascript).

### Install with NPM

`npm install stream-chat stream-chat-react`

### Install with Yarn

`yarn add stream-chat stream-chat-react`

### Install via CDN

In case you are not using a package manager or you would like to build a simple proof of concept in Codepen for example, you can also load the SDK through a direct script link. If you choose to do so, please make sure that you explicitly specify the version of the SDK you will use. 

```
<!-- Replace VERSION with the version of stream-chat and stream-chat-react -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/stream-chat@VERSION"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/stream-chat-react@VERSION"></script>
```

With the installation out of the way, let's explore the basics of the SDK.
