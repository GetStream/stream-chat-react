The `ChannelList` displays a list of `channels` via a state variable of the same name. The SDK provides a variety of hooks that are used within the component to handle events related to updates for a `channel`.
The list's state variable is then updated accordingly via the hooks.

Rather than exporting these individual hooks for customization purposes, many of these event listeners accept custom handler functions, which allows you to override the library's default event response behavior.

To view the list of these custom handler functions to override (if there is one), see the `ChannelList` [documentation](../components/core-components/channel-list.mdx/#event-listeners).
