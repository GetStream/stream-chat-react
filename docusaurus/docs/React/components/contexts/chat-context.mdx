The `ChatContext` is exposed by the [`Chat`](../core-components/chat.mdx) component. Since `Chat` wraps the entire chat application, all other components in the library
have access to the values stored in this context. You can access the context values by calling the `useChatContext` custom hook.

## Basic Usage

Pull values from context with our custom hook:

```jsx
const { client, setActiveChannel } = useChatContext();
```

## Values

### client

The `StreamChat` client instance. Any methods from the `stream-chat-js` API interface can be run off this object.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| object |

### channel

The currently active channel, which populates the [`Channel`](../core-components/channel.mdx) component.

| ------- |
| Channel |

### closeMobileNav

The function to close mobile navigation.

| Type     |

### customClasses

for implementation assistance.

| Type   |

### getAppSettings

The callback function used to get available client-side app settings, includes image and file upload config.

| Type     |

### latestMessageDatesByChannel

### theme

| Type  |
| ----- |
| Theme |

### themeVersion

Stream chat theme version 2 has been introduced with the release of stream-chat-react v10.0.0. This flag is used internally by some UI components of the SDK and the integrators shouldn't need to use it. The value is extracted from a CSS variable `--str-chat__theme-version`. You can set it to values `'1'` or `'2'` in your stylesheets and import the corresponding v2 stylesheet from `stream-chat-react/dist`. Find out more about benefits that the theme version 2 brings to the integrators with [the theming guide](../../theming/introduction.mdx).

|   Type         |  Default  |
| -------------- | --------- |
| `'1'` \| `'2'` |   `'1'`   |

### useImageFlagEmojisOnWindow

Windows 10 does not support country flag emojis out of the box. It chooses to render these emojis as characters instead.
Stream Chat can override this behavior by loading a custom web font that will render images instead (PNGs or SVGs depending
on the platform). Set this prop to true if you want to use these custom emojis for Windows users.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | false   |
