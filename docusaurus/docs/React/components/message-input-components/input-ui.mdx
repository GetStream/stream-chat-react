The Input UI component consumes the [`MessageInputContext`](../contexts/message-input-context.mdx) and handles the display and functionality
for the message input in a channel. The Input UI component is typically a combination of subcomponents that each consume
context and are responsible for one aspect of the message input (ex: text input or emoji picker).

## Basic Usage

To use your own custom Input UI component, utilize the `Input` prop on either the `Channel` or `MessageInput` component. Adding the
prop to `Channel` will inject your component into the `ComponentContext` and adding to `MessageInput` will override
any value stored in context. So if both props are added, the value delivered to `MessageInput` will take precedence.

```jsx
const CustomInput = () => {
  // consume `MessageInputContext` and render custom component here
};

<Chat client={client}>
  <Channel channel={channel} Input={CustomInput}>
    <MessageList />
    <MessageInput />
  </Channel>
</Chat>;
```

:::note
If an `Input` prop is not provided, the `MessageInput` component will render [`MessageInputFlat`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react/blob/master/src/components/MessageInput/MessageInputFlat.tsx)
as its Input UI component by default.

## UI Customization

`MessageInputFlat` is designed to serve as a guide in helping build a custom Input UI component. At a high level, this
pre-built, default component wraps a subset of composable components that each serve specific logic and design-based purposes.

For example, if we strip `MessageInputFlat` down to its core pieces, the component return resembles the following snippet:

```jsx
<div>
  <ImageDropzone>
    <QuotedMessagePreview />
    <UploadsPreview />
    <EmojiPicker />
    <ChatAutoComplete />
    <FileUploadButton />
    <SendButton />
  </ImageDropzone>
</div>
```

:::note
`ImageDropzone` and `FileUploadButton` are imported from ['react-file-utils'](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-file-utils).
:::

We recommend building an Input UI component in a similar way. You can mix and match any of the UI subcomponents and arrange
in a layout that meets your design specifications. All of these UI subcomponents are exported by the library and may be used within
your custom Input UI component. Each subcomponent consumes the `MessageInputContext` and requires no/minimal props to run.

For a detailed example, review the [Input UI Customization](../../guides/theming/input-ui.mdx) example.

## Props

:::note
The Input UI component only consumes context and does not accept any optional props.
