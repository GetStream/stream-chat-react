title: View Components and Thread Adapter
---

ChatView set of components is a view switching mechanism that can be utilised by integrators to quickly implement switching between thread and channel views.

Available components:

- `ChatView` - wrapper with context holding the information about currently active view (`channels` & `threads`)
- `ChatView.Threads` - view used for thread-focused application structure with `ThreadsViewContext` that _can be_ utilised by `ThreadList` to set active thread
- `ChatView.Channels` - view used for channel-focused application structure
- `ChatView.Selector` - list with buttons with bound actions for switching views
- `ChatView.ThreadAdapter` - utilises `ThreadsViewContext` and wraps `Thread` component in necessary `ThreadProvider`

This set of components is provided as-is and offers very limited customizability as the underlying logic is super simple. Integrators are encouraged to build their own switching system if they require it.

### Usage

```tsx
import {
  Chat,
  ChatView,
  ChannelList,
  Channel,
  ThreadList,
  Thread,
  Window,
} from 'stream-chat-react';

// application structure which allows users to switch between views
<Chat client={client}>
  <ChatView>
    <ChatView.Selector />
    {/* channel-focused structure */}
    <ChatView.Channels>
      <ChannelList filters={filters} options={options} sort={sort} />
      <Channel>
        <Window>
          <ChannelHeader />
          <MessageList />
          <MessageInput focus />
        </Window>
        <Thread />
      </Channel>
    </ChatView.Channels>
    {/* thread-focused structure */}
    <ChatView.Threads>
      <ThreadList />
      <ChatView.ThreadAdapter>
        <Thread />
      </ChatView.ThreadAdapter>
    </ChatView.Threads>
  </ChatView>
</Chat>;
```

### Custom Thread-focused Structure

To build your custom thread-focused structure you'll need these four baseline components; `Thread`, `ThreadList`, `ThreadProvier` and `WithComponents` for component overrides.

:::note
For presentation purposes our custom `ThreadListItemUi` component is loosely defined within `CustomThreadsView` and thus it isn't stable. To achieve best performance make sure your components
are stable and defined outside other component's scope.
:::

```tsx
import { WithComponents, ThreadListItemUi, ThreadList, ThreadProvider } from 'stream-chat-react';

export const CustomThreadsView = () => {
  const [activeThread, setActiveThread] = useState(undefined);

  return (
    <div className='custom-threads-view'>
      <WithComponents
        overrides={{
          ThreadListItemUi: () => {
            const thread = useThreadListItemContext()!;
            return (
              <ThreadListItemUi
                onPointerDown={() => setActiveThread(thread)}
                aria-selected={thread === activeThread}
              />
            );
          },
        }}
      >
        <ThreadList />
      </WithComponents>

      <ThreadProvider thread={activeThread}>
        <Thread />
      </ThreadProvider>
    </div>
  );
};
```
