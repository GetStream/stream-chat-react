The SDK supports variety of avatar component types. Different approach is taken to display a channel avatar and an avatar of a message author.

The channel avatar accounts for the fact that the channel may contain more than two members and thus become a group channel. Therefore, it renders a `GroupAvatar` component in case of more than two channel members and `Avatar` in case of two or less channel members.
On the other hand, messages use the avatars for a specific single user and thus using the `Avatar` component exclusively.

The `Avatar` component displays an image, with fallback to the first letter of the optional name prop. The `GroupAvatar` displays up to four `Avatar` components in a 2x2 grid.

## Customizing Avatar component

The SDK's default `Avatar` component is used by the following components:

- `ChannelSearch` results for users
- `Message`
- `QuotesMessage`
- `MesageStatus`
- `QuotedMessagePreview` in message composer
- Suggestion items for user mentions
- `Poll`
- Message `Reactions`
- `ThreadList`

Passing your custom avatar component to `Channel` prop `Avatar` overrides the avatar for all the above components.

Here's an example of using the `Avatar` component within a custom preview component:

```tsx
import { Channel } from 'stream-chat-react';
import type { AvatarProps } from 'stream-chat-react';

const Avatar = (props: AvatarProps) => {
  return <div>Custom avatar UI</div>;
};

<Channel Avatar={Avatar} />;
```

## Customizing Channel Avatar

You can also take advantage of the `Avatar` prop on the `ChannelHeader` and `ChannelList` components to override just that aspect of these components specifically, see the example below.

An example of overriding just the `Avatar` component in the default `ChannelPreview` component.

```tsx
import type { ChannelAvatarProps } from 'stream-chat-react';

const CustomChannelAvatar = (props: ChannelAvatarProps) => {
  return <div>Custom Channel Avatar</div>;
};

<ChannelList Avatar={CustomChannelAvatar} />;
```

To override channel avatar in `ChannelHeader` we need to provide our component to `Channel` prop `ChannelAvatar`:

```tsx
import { Channel } from 'stream-chat-react';
import type { ChannelAvatarProps } from 'stream-chat-react';

const CustomChannelAvatar = (props: ChannelAvatarProps) => {
  return <div>Custom Channel Avatar</div>;
};

<Channel ChannelAvatar={CustomChannelAvatar} />;
```
