The `Window` component handles width changes in the main channel to ensure a seamless user experience when opening and closing a `Thread` component.

## Basic Usage

The `Window` component must wrap the main channel components to enable smooth mount and unmount behavior. It must be rendered at the same level as the `Thread`.
This ensures correct width changes in the main channel when opening and closing a `Thread`.

```tsx
<Chat client={client}>
  <Channel channel={channel}>
    <Window>
      <MessageList />
      <MessageInput />
    </Window>
    <Thread />
  </Channel>
</Chat>
```

## Props

### thread

An optional prop to manually trigger the opening of a thread.
