id: thread-list-item
title: ThreadListItem
---

An item component rendered within [`ThreadList` component](./thread-list.mdx). The item is divided into two components:

`ThreadListItem` - a component and provider which renders `ThreadListItemUi`
`ThreadListItemUi` - a component which renders the actual UI elements

The goal is that as integrator you can provide a different look to your component while preserving the behavior or you can replace the behavior while keeping the default UI or you can change both if you require so.

## Props

### thread

A thread instance provided by the [`ThreadList`](../core-components/thread-list.mdx).
