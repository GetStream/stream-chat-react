The `Chat` component is a React Context provider that wraps the entire Stream Chat application. It provides the [`ChatContext`](../contexts/chat-context.mdx)
to its children, which includes the `StreamChat` client instance. All other components within the library must be nested as children
of `Chat` to maintain proper functionality.

## Basic Usage

The `Chat` component does not inject any UI, so its implementation is fairly simple. Once an instance of the `StreamChat` client
has been created, you pass the client object as a prop to add it to the `ChatContext`.

```jsx
<Chat client={client}>
  <Channel channel={channel}>
    <MessageList />
    <MessageInput />
  </Channel>
</Chat>
```

Any child of the `Chat` component has access to the `ChatContext`. Each React Context in the component library can be accessed with
one of our custom hooks, which must be imported individually. The `ChatContext` values are accessed with `useChatContext` hook.

```jsx
const { client } = useChatContext();
```

## Props

### <div class="label required basic">Required</div> client

The `StreamChat` client instance. Any methods from the `stream-chat-js` API interface can be run off this object.

```jsx
const channel = client.channel('messaging', {
  members: ['nate', 'roy'],
});
```

  language: 'es',
  translationsForLanguage: {
    'Nothing yet...': 'Nada',

### useImageFlagEmojisOnWindows

Windows 10 does not support country flag emojis out of the box. It chooses to render these emojis as characters instead.
Stream Chat can override this behavior by loading a custom web font that will render images instead (PNGs or SVGs depending
on the platform). Set this prop to true if you want to use these custom emojis for Windows users.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | false   |
