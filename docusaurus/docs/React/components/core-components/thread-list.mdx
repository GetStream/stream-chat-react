`ThreadList` is a component which renders individual thread instances ([`Thread`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/thread.ts)) stored within `ThreadManager`. It handles pagination triggers and virtualization through the help of the [Virtuoso]() virtualized list component. The rest of the business logic lives within ThreadManager and Thread classes. ThreadManager instance gets activated whenever ThreadList renders - activation is necessary as it tells the SDK that user "sees" this list and can update state accordingly whenever appropriate events arrive.

If used in default form and rendered within `ThreadView` component it also allows to set active thread and handles `Thread` activation (similar to `ThreadManager` activation).

## Basic Usage

```tsx
<Chat client={client}>
  {/*...*/}
  <ThreadList />
</Chat>
```

## Props

### virtuosoProps

Props to be passed to the underlying [`react-virtuoso` virtualized list dependency](https://virtuoso.dev/virtuoso-api/interfaces/VirtuosoProps/).
