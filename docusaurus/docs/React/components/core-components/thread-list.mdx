`ThreadList` is a component which renders individual thread instances ([`Thread`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/thread.ts)) stored within [`ThreadManager`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/thread_manager.ts). It handles pagination triggers and virtualization through the help of the [Virtuoso](https://virtuoso.dev) virtualized list component. The rest of the business logic lives within ThreadManager and Thread classes. ThreadManager instance gets activated whenever ThreadList renders - activation is necessary as it tells the SDK that user "sees" this list and can update state accordingly whenever appropriate events arrive.

If used in default form and rendered within [`ThreadView` component](../utility-components/chat-view.mdx) it also allows to set active thread and handles [`Thread`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/thread.ts) activation (similar to [`ThreadManager`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/thread_manager.ts) activation).

## Basic Usage

```tsx
<Chat client={client}>
  {/*...*/}
  <ThreadList />
</Chat>
```
