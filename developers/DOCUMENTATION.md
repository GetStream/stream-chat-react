# Documenting the SDK

If you are introducing changes impacting the API or behavior of the SDK parts, you should document these. Our documentation is generated with [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs). We have our own cli tool [stream-chat-docusaurus-cli](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-docusaurus-cli#installation-and-using-the-cli) to run the documentation server locally, so that you can inspect your adjustments.

## Run the documentation server locally

1. **Install [stream-chat-docusaurus-cli](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-docusaurus-cli#installation-and-using-the-cli)**

2. **Run the documentation server**


```bash
yarn docs-run
```
