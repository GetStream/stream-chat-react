## [2.0.1](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react/releases/tag/v2.0.1) 2020-07-15

We’re bumping `stream-chat-react` to version 2.0.1 because over the past three months we’ve been doing a major refactor of our codebase. The foundational work includes:

- Major refactor and code cleanup
- Components have been rewritten to use React Hooks
- Added tests for all components
- Performance improvements on MessageList
- Upgraded dependencies

### Breaking changes

- Drop node 11, 13
- Deprecating context HOC’s
  Since we moved our library to rely on React Hooks moved the following HOC’s to use `useContext` :
  - `withChannelContext`
  - `withChatContext`
  - `withTranslationContext`
    This means we now directly use the context values from the context and they’re not passed down from the props anymore.
- The `updateMessage` on the channel context does not support extraState anymore.
- There no longer is a ref inside a ref in ReactionsList. Instead, the ref of the container div is directly forwarded by the component.

### Addidtions

- Triggers on MessageInput can now be overwritten using the autocompleteTriggers prop on `MessageInput`

### Fixes

- Fixed styling on autocomplete suggestions
- Fixed YouTube video rendering in messages
- Fixed an issue that allowed you to send empty messages
- Bugfix in groupStyles calculations

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react/releases/tag/v1.1.0) 2020-06-08

**Breaking Change**

- Migrated ChannelList component to functional component.

  `ChannelList` component comes with some default handlers for following events.

  1. notification.message_new
  2. notification.added_to_channel
  3. notification.removed_from_channel
  4. channel.updated
  5. channel.deleted
  6. channel.truncated

  But these default event handlers can be overriden by providing corresponding
  prop functions for handling the event. For example, to override `notification.message_new` event,
  you can provide prop function - `onMessageNew`, to ChannelList component.

  Until now, ChannelList component was class based, so function prop (e.g., `onMessageNew`) used to accept
  following 2 parameters:

  1. thisArg - `this` reference of component. You could use this to update the state of the
     component as well. e.g., `thisArg.setState({ ... })`
  2. event - Event object

  In this release, we have migrated ChannelList component to functional component and thus
  `thisArg` is no longer accessible. Instead we provide the setter (from `useState` hook) for channels.
  So updated params to these custom event handlers (prop functions) is as follow:

  1. setChannels {function} Setter for channels.
  2. event {object} Event object

  And same applies to all the rest of the custom event handlers:

  - onMessageNew
  - onAddedToChannel
  - onRemovedFromChannel
  - onChannelUpdated
  - onChannelTruncated
  - onChannelDeleted

**Fixes:**

- Correctly set attachment type based on mime type
- Fixes to audio component
- Mentions: filter out no-longer-mentioned users on submit

**Other:**

- Type fixes
- Tests
- Refactors

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react/releases/tag/v1.0.0) 2020-05-15

We've already been on a v1 release for a while but never updated our versioning. Right now we're in the process of rewriting our components to be more future proof and we started using hooks, hence the v1.0.0 today.
